# An Interactive Walk Through Machine Learning
Machine Learning is an expansive, wonderful, powerful, **dense, exhaustive** field. With the surge of students into the field, now more than ever resources to teach new explorers of Machine Learning are required. This repo sets out to provide one more resource to welcome others into the world of Machine Learning.

## *Gentle* Introductions
This project is set up for those newly entering the Data Science, and particularly **Machine Learning** space, or those looking to simply refresh their memories. 

Rather than present each algorithm with heavy technical (though inevitably important) jargon and approaches, this notebook offers a *short, concise, and simplified* explanation and application of various M.L. algorithms. 

Although not as detailed as possible, this notebook presents a welcoming introduction into the world of Machine Learning.

## Tech Stack
This demo is written exclusively in **Python**, though makes use of extensive libraries and packages, including: 
- Pandas
  - A Python library used for data visualization and analysis
- MatplotLib
  - A Python library used for data visualization and graphing
- Seaborn
  - A Python library used for statistical graphics
- SkLearn
  - A Machine Learning Python library used to divide and analyze our data

**Note** Despite the above tech stack, this notebook is intended to run as demonstration of Machine Learning algorithms, not testing skills

## Set Up 
There are two distinct ways of setting up this project: 
 1. Download the Github Repository and run on a local I.D.E. or code-editor 
 2. Click the below link. This will transport you to Jupyter Notebook, where each individual algorithm can be run, showing in real-time results.

 If you wish to make changes and edit the notebook to work on your own, simply click **File** and **Make a Copy**
 
    - If you are new to Jupyter Notebook, a great introduction to the online service can be found [here](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tutorial/). 

## Current Topics Explored

In this current iteration, we include mostly **Supervised Learning** Topics, demonstrating:

- Support Vector Machines (or SVMs)
- Decision Tree Regressors and Classifiers
- Random Forrest Regressors
- Linear Regression
- Logistic Regression
- K Neigbors Classifier
- KMeans

Each topic carries with it a *brief explanation* as well as a *short visualization*


## Future Topics to Add

Future topics to add and expand this notebook primarily focus on **Unsupervised Learning** algorithms and some **Semi Supervised Learning** algorithms, such as
- Clustering
  -DBSCAN
  - Hierarchical Cluster Analysis
- Anomaly Detection and Novelty Detection
  - One-Class SVM
  - Isolation Forests
- Semi-Supervised
  - Restricted Boltzmann Machines
- Neural Networks
